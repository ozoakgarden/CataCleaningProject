# Read me
For this course project I created one big R script - containing all steps from reading in the data, modifying, renaming and adding variables, merging and subsetting data as well as - in the last step - creating the main output file with a tidy data set providing averages across all variables by subject and activity.

The R script used is called "step5_data.txt" and is included in this repository.

The file CodeBook.md describes the original data files used, the process of transformation as well as a description of the final data set "step5_data"
